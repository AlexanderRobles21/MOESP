# MOESP
 Multivariable Output-Error State sPace (MOESP) is a deterministic method to identify linear time invariant systems. The MOESP method developed by M. Verhaegen and P. Dewilde is based on the LQ decomposition of Hankel matrix formed from input-output data, where L is lower triangular and Q is orthogonal. A Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) can be performed on a block from the L (L22) matrix to obtain the system order and the extended observability matrix. From this matrix it is possible to estimate the matrices C and A of state-space model. The final step is to solve overdetermined linear equations using the least-squares method to calculate matrices B and D.
